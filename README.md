# Planet Explorer

A simple application which consumes the SWAPI, which displays planets. It consists of a hardcoded login with a restricted home route. The homepage displays all of the planets, where they could be filterd using the search function, added to favourites or even find out the people which inhabit that particular planet. This application was written in the latest version of Angular 6, RxJs, NgRx, Angular Router and SCSS.
